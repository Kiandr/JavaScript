== Simple app for learning client-side Ajax

This application is a mirror of the camping application provided with the PeepCode Ajax Playbook project. The code is not idiomatic Rails code, but mirrors the behavior of the Camping application.

However, those more familiar with Rails may be more comfortable working with this application rather than the Camping app with the same functionality.
